  <p><font size="4">One of my favorite hobbies is grinding on Dead By Daylight with some friends.</p>
  <p>Trying to rank up in that game is not that easy, or i'm just really bad.</p>

  <p>I usually watch Youtube for a bit because i'm really lazy.</p>
  <p>I usually watch people play games or watch people make cool things outside with dirt and no noise.
  <p>Asmr is what I usually listen to before I go to bed, it helps me sleep easier than how I usually do. A lot of people find it weird because it's people whispering into a microphone most of the time.</p>
  <p>It's really calming for me.</p>

  <p>During the week I have a couple DekHockey games. I play for the D5 Dominos team. We're really good but these last couple games have been rough.</p>
  <p>Currently I have 2 goals and 1 assist. Last year when I played I had like 12 goals and 5 assist. We're coming up to our final games before the playoffs start.</p>
  <p>If our DekHockey can win these last couple games we can get third in our division.</p>
  <p>I also watch Hockey, my favorite team from the NHL is the Columbus Blue Jackets. But so far they've been kinda trash.</p></font></center>
