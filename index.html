<p><font size=5><b>Javascript</b>, it's not that hard, well it is till you start to get the hang of things. It starts to get easy really quick. Um, so here are my favorite things I learned how to do.
My favorite one might be the video htmls. In my websites now I have atleast 1 video or more. It makes my website not as boring and it makes my website look kinda cool.
My second favorite is gifs.(which I figured out how to do today). Currently on this website that you're reading this off of I have two gifs, bith are in my hobbies page.
Well now I have three, I really like putting gifs on here, it's kinds fun... and it's easy!&#9830; &#9830; &#9830;</p></font>
