      <p>This was my last website i've done for my Web Design Class.</p>
      <p>This is my favorite wensite I made because I put a lot more work and though into this one.</p>
      <p>I even added a Youtube video just in case you wanted to see it.</p>
      <p>This websites supposed to be our school page, honestly it's not that bad in how I thought it would turn out.&#9830;</p>

      <p>This is my second favorite one. I kinda struggeled on this one if you see. </p>
      <p>I couldn't really find a good color for the background. But otherwise I really like this one a lot.</p>
      <p>Honestly, if I cleaned it up a bit I would really like this one but nothing will beat the one on top of this.&#9830;</p>

        <p>Jedds Tree Care is one of the "best" websites I have made. I got some really nice pictures like someone cutting down a tree and a picture of an ash bore.</p>
        <p>But since our teacher helped with this It won't be my favorite website.&#9830;</p></center>
